# Draft code in python/pseudocode 

Intro scene is menu for difficulty

Game is a flashcard style game

Inspiring games: 
1. https://kana.pro
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSrMKOwH7E (kanji de go)

Maybe a few different game modes would be good to replicate.

Stage four of kana.pro is awful since the words are fake, but the similar pairs feature could be good.

Need a corpus of katakana words probably from free dictionary sites or from the news, need to see if scraping is viable or not.
